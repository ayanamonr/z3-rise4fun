<h1>Objective functions in Z3</h1>
<p style="clear:both;">Be sure to follow along with the examples by clicking the "edit" link in the
corner. See what the tool says, try your own formulas, and experiment!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Z3's main functionality to checking the satisfiability of logical formulas 
over one or more theories. Z3 can produce models for satisfiable formulas.
Yet in many cases arbitrary models are insufficient and applications are really
solving optimization problems: one or more values should be minimal or maximal.
When there are multiple objectives, they should be combined
using Pareto fronts, lexicographic priorities, or optimized independently.
This section describes a feature exposed by Z3 that lets users formulate 
objective functions directly with Z3. Under the hood is a portfolio
of approaches for solving linear optimization problems over SMT 
formulas, MaxSMT, and their combinations.
</p>

<h2>Optimization from the API</h2>

Z3's programmatic 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209030312/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/documentation.html" target="_blank">API</a>
exposes all available optimization features.

<li>
The Solver Foundation OMP format offers several convenient features for expressing 
optimization problems. We provide a backend to problems formulated in OMP from

<li>
The Python API is also convenient for prototyping. The <b>Optimize</b> Python object is used when solving constraints with optimization objectives.

<h2>Arithmetical Optimization</h2>

<p>
The 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209030312/http://www.smt-lib.org/" target="_blank">SMT-LIB 2.0 standard</a>
is extended with three commands for expressing optimization
objectives.

The (<b>maximize</b> <i>t</i>) command instructs <b>check-sat</b> to produce a model
that maximizes the value of term <i>t</i>.
The type of <i>t</i> must be either <b>Int</b>, <b>Real</b>, or <b>BitVec</b>.
</p>

</pre>

<p>
The (<b>minimize</b> <i>t</i>) command instructs <b>check-sat</b> to produce a model
that minimizes the value of term <i>t</i>.
</p>

<a class="listinglink" target="default" href="/web/20201209030312/https://rise4fun.com/Z3/hk9?frame=1&amp;menu=0&amp;course=1">load in editor</a><pre class="listing">

(assert (&gt; y 1))
(minimize (+ x y))
(check-sat)
(get-objectives)
</pre>


<h3>Unbounded Objectives</h3>

Not all objective functions are bounded. 
Z3 indicates that the maxima are at infinity, 
and the minima are negative infinity.

</pre>

<h3>Tight Bounds</h3>
Not all finite bounds can be expressed as real numbers.
Bounds obtained around strict inequalities are expressed using
infinitesimals.

</pre>

<h2>Soft Constraints</h2>

<p>
The (<b>assert-soft</b> <i>formula</i> <b>:weight</b> <i>numeral</i>) command asserts
a weighted soft constraint. The weight must be a positive natural number, but is optional.
If omitted, the weight is set to 1. 
</p>

<h2>Combining Objectives</h2>
Many optimization problems require solving multiple objectives.
<h3>Lexicographic Combination</h3>
Z3 uses by default a lexicographic priority of objectives.
It solves first for the objective that is declared first.

(assert (&lt; z 5))
(assert (not (= x y)))
(maximize x)
(maximize y)
(check-sat)
(get-model)
(get-objectives)
</pre>
It is also possible to declare multiple classes of soft assertions.
To do this, use an optional tag to differentiate classes of
soft assertions.

(assert (= a c))
(assert (not (and a b)))

</pre>

<h3>Pareto Fronts</h3>
To override lexicographic priorities, 
set the option <b>opt.priority</b> to <b>pareto</b>.

<h2>A Small Case Study</h2>
In collaboration with Anh-Dung Phan.

<h3>Problem description</h3>
Use the problem of virtual machine placement as an example.
Assume that we have three virtual machines (VMs) which require 100, 50 and 15 GB hard disk respectively.
There are three servers with capabilities 100, 75 and 200 GB in that order. 
Find out a way to place VMs into servers in order to

<il>
<li> Minimize the number of servers used
<li> Minimize the operation cost (the servers have fixed daily costs 10, 5 and 20 USD respectively.)
</il>

<h3>Boolean encoding</h3>
We start with a boolean encoding.
Let <i>x<sub>ij</sub></i> denote that VM <i>i</i> is put into server <i>j</i> and <i>y<sub>j</sub></i> 
denote that server <i>j</i> is in use.

               (* 15 (bool_to_int x33))) 
            (* 200 (bool_to_int y3))))

; Optimization goals are expressed implicitly via <i>assert-soft</i> command.
(assert-soft (not y1) :id num_servers)

(assert-soft (not y3) :id num_servers)

(assert-soft (not y2) :id costs :weight 5)
(assert-soft (not y3) :id costs :weight 20)

(check-sat)
(get-model)

The <i>assert-soft</i> command represents MaxSMT which tries to maximize the weighted sum of boolean expressions belonged to the same id.
Since we are doing minimization, negation is needed to take advantage of MaxSMT support.

<h3>Integer encoding</h3>
In this example, the boolean encoding is not really natural. 
Most of the constraints is of arithmetic form, it makes more 
sense to express them using integer arithmetic.

Here is a similar encoding using integer arithmetic.

The capability constraints and goals are easier to express than those of boolean encoding.
However, we need to add extra constraints to ensure that only 0-1 integers are allowed in the model.
It is also interesting to see different results by choosing various ways of combining objectives. 
You can uncomment the <i>set-option</i> command and take a look at results.



<h2>Advanced topics</h2>

<h3>Difference Logic</h3>
Z3 uses by default an implementation of dual Simplex to 
solve feasibility and primal Simplex for optimality.
For arithmetical constraints that only have differences
between variables, known as <i>difference logic</i>, 
Z3 furthermore contains alternative decision procedures
tuned for this domain.
These have to be configured explicitly.
There is a choice between a solver tuned for sparse constraints
(where the ratio of variables is high compared to number of inequalities)
and a solver tuned for dense constraints.

(get-objectives)
</pre>

<h3>Weighted Max-SAT solvers, a portfolio</h3>
The default solver for unweighted MaxSAT problems (when all weights 
of the soft constraints are set to 1) is the Fu-Malik algorithm.
The default solver used for weighted MaxSAT problems is 
called <b>wmax</b>. It uses a simple decision procedure
that bounds weights.
Several alternatives are available and they may scale better
for your application.
For weighted MaxSAT problems you can select the following
engines <i>wpm2</i> (use an implementation of the WPM2 algorithm by Ans�tegui et.al.), 
<i>bcd2</i> (use an implementation of the bincd algorithm by Heras et.al.), 
<i>pbmax</i> (refine bounds iteratively based on Pseudo-Boolean inequalities), 
<i>hsmax</i> (use separation into solving hitting sets by Davies et.al.).
To select the <i>hsmax</i> engine, set the option
<pre class="listing">
  (set-option :opt.wmaxsat_engine hsmax)
</pre>
Note that our implementations of these engines do not 
(yet) perform as well as the default on most
benchmarks we have tried.

The option 
<pre class="listing">
  (set-option :opt.enable_sat true)
</pre>
is made available for the <i>pbmax</i> solver. It causes Pseudo-Boolean constraints to be
compiled into propositional logic. It uses a more efficient SAT solver if the input
can be compiled directly to SAT. If not, <i>pbmax</i> uses a custom Pseudo-Boolean theory
solver. 
In fact, the default behavior of the optimization engine is to 
detect 0-1 variables from bounds constraints and use a Pseudo-Boolean solver
for these. Maximization objectives over 0-1 variables are also translated to
MaxSAT form such that one of the MaxSAT engines can be used.
To disable this translation use
<pre class="listing">
  (set-option :opt.elim_01 false)
</pre>
The Pseudo-Boolean solver is in some, often pathological, 
cases more efficient than using a SAT solver. For example,
it handles pidgeon hole problems well.
Since cutting planes are expensive, they are applied infrequently.
To set their frequency use:
<pre class="listing">
  (set-option :smt.pb.conflict_frequency 1)
</pre>
The Pseudo-Boolean solver contains a few tricks.
It compiles cardinality constraints and other pseudo-Boolean
inequalities with small coefficients into sorting circuits.
It performs this compilation on-demand, after the inequalities
have been used beyond a threshold.
To disable compilation use:
<pre class="listing">
  (set-option :smt.pb.enable_compilation false)
</pre>
The Pseudo-Boolean theory solver also uses dual simplex to prune 
infeasible branches. For constraints with many equalities and inequalities
this option can be quite helpful. The option is off by default as it often
incurs more overhead than benefit.
To enable this option use:
<pre class="listing">
  (set-option :smt.pb.enable_simplex true)
</pre>

   opt.enable_sls=true

<h3>Pseudo Boolean Constraints</h3>
Many problems are naturally expressed using integers that can take the values 
of either 0 or 1. 

The Pseudo-Boolean solver is in some, often pathological, 
cases more efficient than using a SAT solver. For example,
it handles pidgeon hole problems well.
