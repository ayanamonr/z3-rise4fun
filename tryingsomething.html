<h1>Getting Started with Z3: A Guide</h1>
<p style="clear:both;">Be sure to follow along with the examples by clicking the "edit" link in the
corner. See what the tool says, try your own formulas, and experiment!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Z3 is a state-of-the art theorem prover from Microsoft Research. It  
can be used to check the satisfiability of logical formulas over one or more theories. 
Z3 offers a compelling match for software analysis and verification tools, since several 
common software constructs map directly into supported theories.
</p>

<p>
The main objective of the tutorial is to introduce the reader on how to use
Z3 effectively for logical modeling and solving.
The tutorial provides some general background on logical modeling, 
but we have to defer a full introduction to first-order logic and 
decision procedures to text-books.
</p>

<p>
Z3 is a low level tool. It is best used
as a component in the context of other tools that require solving logical
formulas. Consequently, Z3 exposes a number of API facilities to make it 
convenient for tools to map into Z3, but there are no stand-alone 
editors or user-centric facilities for interacting with Z3. 
The language syntax used in the front ends favor simplicity in contrast
to linguistic convenience. 
</p>

<h2>Basic Commands</h2>

<p>
The Z3 input format is an extension of the one defined by the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210125011020/http://www.smtlib.org/" target="_blank">SMT-LIB 2.0 standard</a>.
A Z3 script is a sequence of commands. 
The <b>help</b> command displays a list of all available
commands. The command <b>echo</b> displays a message. 
Internally, Z3 maintains a <b>stack</b>
of user provided formulas and declarations. 
We say these are the <b>assertions</b> provided by the user. 
The command <b>declare-const</b> declares a constant of a given type (aka sort). 
The command <b>declare-fun</b> declares a function. 
In the following example, we declared a function that
receives an integer and a boolean, and returns an integer.
    
    
    
      <div id="control-panel">
        <div class="row">
          <input class="cell" id="command-line-args" type="text" value="-smt2" disabled="disabled" />
          <span id="run-cell"><input id="run" type="button" value="Loadingâ€¦" disabled="disabled" /></span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <pre id="stdout"></pre>
      <div id="footer">
        Source: <a href="https://github.com/ViRb3/z3-wasm">GitHub</a>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    
The command <b>assert</b>
adds a formula into the Z3 internal stack. 
We say the set of formulas in the Z3 stack is <b>satisfiable</b>
if there is an interpretation (for the user declared constants and functions)
that makes all asserted formulas true.
</p>
<a class="listinglink" target="default" href="/web/20210125011020/https://www.rise4fun.com/Z3/E?frame=1&amp;menu=0&amp;course=1"></a><div><textarea rows="5" style="width: 100%;">(declare-const a Int)
(declare-fun f (Int Bool) Int)
(assert (&gt; a 10))
(assert (&lt; (f a true) 100))
(check-sat)
</textarea><button>Run</button><br><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">sat</code></div> 
<p>
The first asserted formula states that the constant <tt>a</tt> must be greater than 10.
The second one states that the function <tt>f</tt> applied to <tt>a</tt> and <tt>true</tt> must
return a value less than 100.
The command <b>check-sat</b> determines whether the current formulas on the Z3 stack
are satisfiable or not. 
If the formulas are satisfiable, Z3 returns <b>sat</b>. If they are not satisfiable (i.e., they are <b>unsatisfiable</b>),
Z3 returns <b>unsat</b>. Z3 may also return <b>unknown</b> when it can't determine whether a formula
is satisfiable or not.
</p>

<p> 
When the command check-sat returns <b>sat</b>, the command <b>get-model</b> can be used to retrieve 
an interpretation that makes all formulas on the Z3 internal stack true.
</p> 
<a class="listinglink" target="default" href="/web/20210125011020/https://www.rise4fun.com/Z3/E8?frame=1&amp;menu=0&amp;course=1"></a><div><textarea rows="6" style="width: 100%;">(declare-const a Int)
(declare-fun f (Int Bool) Int)
(assert (&gt; a 10))
(assert (&lt; (f a true) 100))
(check-sat)
(get-model)
</textarea><button>Run</button><br><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;"></code></div> 

<p>
The interpretation is provided using <b>definitions</b>. 
For example, the definition: </p>
<code>
(define-fun a () Int [val])
</code>
<p>
states that the value of <tt>a</tt> in the model is <tt>[val]</tt>.
The definition: </p>
<code>
(define-fun f ((x!1 Int) (x!2 Bool)) Int
   ...
)
</code>
<p>
is very similar to a function definition used in programming languages.
In this example, <tt>x1</tt> and <tt>x2</tt> are the arguments of the function interpretation
created by Z3. For this simple example, the definition of <tt>f</tt> is based on
<b>ite</b>'s (aka if-then-elses or conditional expressions). For example, the expression:
</p>
<code>
(ite (and (= x!1 11) (= x!2 false)) 21 0)
</code>
<p>
evaluates (returns) 21 when <tt>x!1</tt> is equal to 11, and <tt>x!2</tt> is equal to false.
Otherwise, it returns 0.
